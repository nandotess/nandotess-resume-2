I'm Team Leader at The Pixel Shop (Toronto, Canada), a creative agency focused on web development. In this role I share the projects and technical leadership, sharing the overseeing of a team of 8 developers. Our most exciting works to date were creating the Law Society of Ontario website and The Royal Conservatory website, both Kentico websites accessible & responsive, integrated with different back office and systems.

Before joining The Pixel Shop, I worked for a media corporation and for my own creative web agency - RBS Group (Porto Alegre, Brazil) and SantoPixel (Porto Alegre, Brazil) - and was lucky enough to work with amazing websites based on Java/JSTL and PHP/WordPress, using a range of front-end technologies such Angular.

Iâ€™m truly passionate about my work and always eager to connect with other developers, designers and project managers. While I enjoy all aspects of my job, I think my favourite stage of a project is working on the front-end development making all design and ideas in real and interactive content.

My key skills are based on WordPress, Angular 4+ and Frontend development (JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Foundation, Bootstrap, Sass and Gulp). I'm also a DevOps enthusiast with some experience with Microsoft Azure, Azure DevOps, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery and Jenkins.
