# Introduction

Over the last 20 years, I've navigated the dynamic landscape of software engineering, immersing myself in a variety of digital, IT, and marketing projects. With an associate's degree in Administration, I've blended technical expertise with leadership acumen to drive team success and project completion.

# Tech Lead Experience

In my role as Tech Lead, I’ve created an environment that balances productivity with personal career aspirations. The result? A symbiotic relationship where both individual and company goals are met, and often surpassed.

# Software Engineering Journey

As a Software Engineer, I've been hands-on in every phase of numerous digital and IT projects. My steadfast commitment is to deliver on time, within budget, and beyond expectations. This approach has been my guiding star, from the initial planning stage right through to the final deployment.

# Project Development

I've shaped and refined project development processes at several companies. This experience afforded me the opportunity to work on large-scale projects for corporations such as Volvo Cars, Manulife, and Kelsey Media. Each project has reinforced my belief in aligning my efforts with the client's business objectives and corporate governance.

# Current Endeavors

I've now embarked on a mission to revolutionize health and nutrition in America. Our goal is clear: reduce the impact of diet-related diseases and subsequently lower healthcare costs across the board—from insurers and businesses to everyday people.

On another front, at História do Grenal, a project I co-founded, we're bringing a refreshing perspective to local sports rivalries by showcasing unprecedented statistics coupled with inventive data visualizations.

# Past Expertise

Over the years, I've worked with a wide array of technologies, including WordPress, AngularJS, Angular, Bootstrap, Foundation, jQuery, XSL, PHP, Java, and .NET. This diverse technical experience enhances my adaptability and problem-solving capabilities in the ever-evolving software development landscape.

# Awards and Recognition

My dedication and commitment have earned me awards like "Individual that Delivered the Most Features on Time" at Deliverr Inc. in 2022 and "Employee of the Year" at The Pixel Shop in 2019. These accolades serve as a constant reminder of my pledge to excellence in the software engineering field.
