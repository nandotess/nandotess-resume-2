Hello! I'm a Brazilian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Full Stack Developer. Living in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ since 2017.

The technologies I've been working on recently are all related (at a certain level) to Jamstack: Vanilla JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, End-to-end tests (Cypress), Headless CMS (Sanity.io, MongoDB Atlas, WordPress) and the traditional UI combo HTML and CSS.

In the past, I had the opportunity to work with a range of technologies - front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, AngularJS, Angular, Bootstrap, Foundation, jQuery, XSL) and back-end (PHP, Java, .NET, Apache Solr, JSTL, ASP Classic). And with different types of clients - from small companies to big corporations; from Brazil, South Africa and Canada.

All these opportunities helped me to shape my soft and hard skills, managing clients' expectations and working closely with product managers and designers to build high-quality products.
