Hello! I'm a Brazilian Full Stack Developer.

The technologies I've been working recently are all related (in certain level) to Jamstack: Vanilla JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, End-to-end tests (Cypress), Headless CMS (Sanity.io, MongoDB Atlas, WordPress) and the traditional UI combo HTML and CSS.

The technologies I'm studying at this moment are Redux, GraphQL and Typescript.

In the past, I had the opportunity to work with a range of technologies - front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Sass, AngularJS, Angular, Bootstrap, Foundation, jQuery, XSL, ...) and back-end (PHP, Java, .NET, Apache Solr, JSTL, ASP Classic, ...). And with different types of clients - from small companies to big corporations; from Brazil, South Africa and Canada. All these opportunities helped me to shape my soft and hard skills, managing clients' expectations and working closely with product managers and designers to build high-quality products.

Currently, living and working in Canada, I'm a Lead Web Developer of a Toronto-based web agency (The Pixel Shop). In 2020 I also joined the Codeable family, already completing 39 projects so far.
